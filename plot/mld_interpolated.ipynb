    "Calculating the mld depth using interpolation of the s-levels in the Norkyst dataset. This creates more continous depths and might make the mld calculations more accurate than using a transformation method from s_rho to z_rho. This notebook is to visualize the differences and compare these two methods of calculating the mld. I will use the xarray interpolation feature as recommended by a colleauge. Ill try using a linear method. If this interpolation lacks effiency, I might consider using xroms and sgrid instead, but I will try to stick with xarray."
